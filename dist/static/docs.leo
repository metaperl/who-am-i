Your strawman was born the same day you were, but the government did not tell you about it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME7K6P7hlko&amp;feature=emb_title

I currently find Orgasmic Mindfulness or the Teachings of Erwan Davon to be the most practical.

The divorce rate is over 50% and many of those in marriages are unhappy. www.unfencedrelationships.com provides a real relationship solution. JJ Roberts is a genius. Too bad he cares more about money for himself than forming a community.

* a book written by John C. Lilly, inventor of the Isolation Tank
* the part of every hurricane: no matter how much craziness is occurring, every hurricane has a Quiet Center that a plane can fly into unperturbed.
* an analogy for the shakshibhava - the silent witness of all events. I AM = Sat-Chit-Ananda: the uncreated witness of the 5 lower sheaths: (1) food-sheath (2) prana sheath (3) lower-mind (4) higher-mind (5) bliss
* An intentional community based around spiritual practices that work certainly and work fast (15 minutes to 21 days). I spent 31 days at Madre Grande monastery and I did have a transformation but it could have been faster and more certain with the methods available at http://TheQuietCenter.org - orgasmic mindfulness, isolation tank, pranayama ... conflict resolution and forgiveness are a must in community ... who is really willing to sacrifice their ego in community?
